## Challenge 1: Sort Words by Character Count
Write a function that sorts a list of words by the number of occurrences of the character “a” within each word, in decreasing order. If some words contain the same number of “a” characters, sort those words by their lengths.

Input:

["aaaasd", "a", "aab", "aaabcd", "ef", "cssssssd", "fdz", "kf", "zc", "lklklklklklklklkl", "l"]

Output:

["aaaasd", "aaabcd", "aab", "a", "lklklklklklklklkl", "cssssssd", "fdz", "ef", "kf", "zc", "l"]

## Challenge 2: Recursive Function
Write a recursive function which takes one integer parameter. Please bear in mind that finding the algorithm needed to generate the output below is the main point of the question.

Input:

9

Output:

2

4

9

## Challenge 3: Find Most Repeated Data
Write a function which takes one parameter as an array/list. The function should find the most repeated data within the given array. Test with different datasets.

Input:

["apple","pie","apple","red","red","red"]

Output:

"red"
